# Description
The store owner wants to retrieve a list of all the products which are under `100` in terms of quantity so that they can order more stock in advance.

Your task is to retrieve and display all the products from the `store` table where the quantity is less than 100. You have to retrieve all the columns from the selected products. You need to display each row in the following format:
```
{id}, {name}, {category}, {price}, {quantity}
```

### Hints
> Hint: This time it is a query so you will use `ExecuteReader()` method for executing the `SELECT` statement;
